However, SonarQube identified significant issues in bedrock_llm.py - notably a very high cognitive complexity (39 vs allowed 15) and string duplication problems, indicating some architectural flaws. The use of backoff for retries and asyncio for concurrency demonstrates modern patterns, but the maintainability issues suggest areas for improvement.",
