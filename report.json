      "category": "Innovation & Creativity",
      "answer": "The AI Code Reviewer solution offers a moderately unique approach, combining SonarQube static analysis with AI-powered code review using multiple LLM models. While static code analysis tools and AI code reviewers exist separately, this solution integrates them with a multi-agent architecture (Validation Agent, SonarQube Parser, NLP Question Agent, Master Agent) orchestrating the review process. The use of parallel processing with multiple AWS Bedrock models (Mistral, LLaMA 3, DeepSeek) is notable. However, SonarQube integration with AI systems is becoming increasingly common in the industry, so I wouldn't classify it as groundbreaking innovation.",

      "answer": "Based on the SonarQube data, there are 3 critical issues related to high cognitive complexity in different parts of the codebase, which suggests some implementation quality issues but doesn't directly indicate missing functionality. The requirements.txt file shows appropriate dependencies for a modern web application with FastAPI, AWS integration, and other necessary components. However, with limited code visibility and no comprehensive implementation details, I cannot definitively confirm all requirements are implemented completely. The available fragments suggest a structured application with CLI capability, but I cannot verify all use cases are covered.",

      "answer": "The solution uses modern best practices including FastAPI, modular design, and AWS Bedrock integration. SonarQube analysis shows critical cognitive complexity issues in three files that exceed recommended thresholds (master_agent.py, zip_processor.py, app.js), indicating areas needing refactoring. Dependencies like FastAPI and boto3 are current versions. While the architecture follows modern patterns with separation of concerns, the high cognitive complexity impacts maintainability and should be addressed according to best practices.",

      "answer": "The documentation is comprehensive but incomplete. The README includes a detailed overview of system components, features, model configuration, and backend architecture. It provides information about validation agents, SonarQube parsing, and the web UI. However, it's missing actual setup and running instructions, which are explicitly mentioned in the question. There's also no reference to any demo video. The README starts strong but doesn't fulfill the specific requirements of setup instructions and demo video.",
